# The Phonetic Map: How AI Speaks 193 Languages with Just 12 Voices

With 193 supported languages in our animated chatbot, understanding linguistic relationships has become essential. As AI improves in language ability, there's tremendous opportunity to benefit from deep linguistic knowledge. Here's a comprehensive guide to the languages we support and how they relate to each other phonetically.

## Statistics

## 🌳 Language Families & Phonetic Mapping

For the 181 languages without native voices, we use **phonetic mapping** to select the most natural-sounding fallback voice based on linguistic relationships.

### 🏝️ Austronesian Languages → Filipino Voice

These languages share vowel-heavy phonology, syllable-timed rhythm, and similar phonotactic patterns with Filipino.

- **Native:** Filipino/Tagalog
- **Mapped:** Indonesian, Malay, Javanese, Sundanese, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Balinese, Malagasy, Hawaiian, Samoan, Maori, Fijian

### 🏔️ Slavic & Post-Soviet Languages → Russian Voice

Shared Cyrillic heritage, similar consonant clusters, and palatalization patterns make Russian an ideal fallback.

- **Native:** Russian
- **Mapped:** Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Tajik, Georgian, Armenian

### 🐉 Sino-Tibetan & Tonal SE Asian → Chinese Voice

These languages share tonal systems, monosyllabic tendencies, and similar prosodic patterns. (Tonal)

- **Native:** Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)
- **Mapped:** Cantonese, Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Burmese, Khmer, Dzongkha, Hmong

### 🕌 Indo-Aryan & South Asian → Hindi Voice

Shared retroflex consonants, aspirated stops, and similar vowel inventories across the Indian subcontinent.

- **Native:** Hindi
- **Mapped:** Bengali, Urdu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Nepali, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Sanskrit

### 💃 Romance Languages → Spanish/French/Italian/Portuguese

Descended from Latin, these languages share vowel systems, rhythm patterns, and similar phoneme inventories.

- **Native:** Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese
- **Mapped:** Catalan → Spanish, Galician → Spanish, Romanian → Italian, Occitan → French, Sicilian → Italian, Latin → Italian, Haitian Creole → French

### 🏰 Germanic Languages → German/English

Continental Germanic languages map to German; North Germanic and Celtic languages map to English for prosodic similarity.

- **Native:** German, English
- **Mapped:** Dutch → German, Afrikaans → German, Yiddish → German, Swedish → English, Norwegian → English, Danish → English, Icelandic → English, Welsh → English, Irish → English

## 🎯 Special Phonetic Considerations

> **🎵 Tonal Languages:** Languages like Thai, Vietnamese, and Cantonese use pitch to distinguish meaning. We map these to Chinese, which also uses tones, for more natural-sounding output.

> **🔤 Script Doesn't Equal Sound:** Many languages share scripts but have very different phonologies. We prioritize phonetic similarity over writing system when choosing fallback voices.

### Interesting Phonetic Relationships

| Language | Maps To | Why? |
|----------|---------|------|
| Korean | Japanese | Similar vowel inventory (a, i, u, e, o), mora-timed rhythm, geographic proximity |
| Greek | Italian | Mediterranean phonetic features, similar vowel clarity |
| Polish, Czech, Slovak | German | Geographic proximity, shared consonant features despite being Slavic |
| Basque | Spanish | Language isolate, but centuries of contact with Spanish speakers |
| Finnish, Hungarian | English | Uralic languages with no close TTS voice available; English as neutral fallback |
| Quechua, Aymara | Spanish | Indigenous languages heavily influenced by Spanish colonization |

## 🌍 Language Diversity Statistics

| Language Family | Count | Example Languages |
|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| Indo-European | ~80 | English, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, Greek, Persian |
| Sino-Tibetan | ~10 | Chinese, Burmese, Tibetan |
| Austronesian | ~25 | Indonesian, Filipino, Maori, Hawaiian |
| Afroasiatic | ~15 | Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Hausa |
| Niger-Congo (Bantu) | ~20 | Swahili, Zulu, Yoruba, Igbo |
| Turkic | ~10 | Turkish, Kazakh, Uzbek, Azerbaijani |

| Koreanic | 1 | Korean |
| Language Isolates | ~5 | Basque, Korean (sometimes classified) |
| Others | ~17 | Various smaller families |

## 💡 Why Phonetic Mapping Matters

> "The goal isn't perfect pronunciation—it's intelligible, natural-sounding speech. A Filipino voice speaking Indonesian sounds far more natural than an English voice attempting the same, even if neither is perfect."

When AI speaks a language without a native voice, the fallback voice determines:

- **Vowel quality** – How naturally vowels sound
- **Rhythm and stress** – Whether the speech feels natural or robotic
- **Consonant approximation** – How close unfamiliar sounds get to the target
- **Overall intelligibility** – Whether listeners can understand the output

By carefully mapping each language to its phonetically closest available voice, we ensure the best possible listening experience across all 193 supported languages.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

As TTS technology advances, we're looking forward to:

- Adding native voices for more languages (Arabic, Korean, and Turkish are top priorities)
- Improving phonetic mappings based on user feedback
- Supporting regional variants (e.g., Latin American Spanish vs. European Spanish)
- Better handling of code-switching and multilingual text
